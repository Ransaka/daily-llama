Sample Response
```md
Based on past newspaper contents, it appears that Dimuth Karunaratne's cricket career has been impacted by recent legal issues. According to a news article from March 2023, he was charged with driving under the influence of liquor and was released on bail after being produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court. Additionally, he has requested the national cricket selection committee to reconsider his request to step down as Sri Lanka's Test captain due to personal reasons. However, it is unclear at this time how these legal issues will affect his playing career moving forward.
